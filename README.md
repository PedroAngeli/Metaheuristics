# Using metaheuristics to optimize the combination of classifiers

A Machine learning project using metaheuristics to optimize the combination of classifiers. Developed in my AI classes.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is try to improve the accuracy of Heterogeneus Pooling implemented [here](https://github.com/PedroAngeli/Classification-models). The metaheuristics used were: Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing e Genetic Algorithm.
